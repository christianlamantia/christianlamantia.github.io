            <p>Christian Lamantia is the perfect person to have on your team.</p>
            <p>You can feel him listening and understanding and know it to be true when he delivers high-quality work in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
            <p>Even though we worked together virtually, Christian never failed to be present and work hard. </p>
            <p>We are so grateful that we got his time, energy, and efforts and would take him back in a heart-beat. </p>
